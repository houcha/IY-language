# Akinator

It is Akinator semblance (see real one at https://en.akinator.com).

Rules: you make up a word and Akinator is going to guess it by asking yes/no questions. You can also get Akinator's definition of object, which is funny enough.

As long you play and as funny the features of objects you enter the more interesting the game is!

Use Graphviz (https://graphviz.gitlab.io) to see actual objects tree.
Use Makefile to build the project.

Yet only Russian language is available.
