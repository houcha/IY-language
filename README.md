# IY-language

In this project I develop my own `IY` language.

The repository consists of many branches (subprojects). Each subproject (even though many of them seem not connected whis language development at all) has a background for language. For instance, `onegin` subproject purpose is to ease files content handling (`Text` class is used by almost every other subproject); `akinator` lays the groundwork for lexeme-tree, which is used by language parser and etc.

Currently language development is in progress.
