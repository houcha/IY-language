# IY-language

In this project I develop my own `IY` language.

The repository consists of many branches (subprojects). Each subproject (even though many of them seem not connected this language development at all) has a background for language. For instance, `onegin` subproject purpose is to ease files content handling (it helps at every language development stage); `akinator` lays the groundwork for lexeme-tree, which is used by language parser and etc.

Currently language development is in progress.
