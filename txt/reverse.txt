To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
You Capulet; shall go along with me:
To know our further pleasure in this case,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
If ever you disturb our streets again,
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
And made Verona's ancient citizens
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
