And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
And made Verona's ancient citizens
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
For this time, all the rest depart away:
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
You Capulet; shall go along with me:
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
